# Image Compression using K-Means Clustering

## Overview
This project implements image compression by reducing the number of colors in an image using K-Means clustering. The algorithm clusters similar pixel colors, replacing them with the cluster centroids to achieve compression while maintaining visual quality.

## Features
- Compresses images by reducing the number of unique colors.
- Uses K-Means clustering to group similar colors.
- Allows customization of the number of clusters (colors) for compression.
- Visualizes the original and compressed images for comparison.
